 ## Introduction
 This is a program for encoding and decoding textfiles using huffman encoding.
 
 ## Usage
 The program can be run with one of two flags. Either -encode or -decode. \n 
 And uses 3 input files like the following: \n
 USAGE:  huffman [OPTION] [FILE0] [FILE1] [FILE2]
 
 FILE0 is the file used for frequency analysis. \n
 FILE1 is the file to encode/decode. \n
 FILE2 is the output file. \n
 
 ## Analysis Frequency analysis
 
 The input file used for frequency analysis can be any UTF-8 textfile. \n
 Note that a larger text file whose characters are in the file to be encoded provides a more efficient \n 
 compression and the resulting output file will thus be smaller.
 
 ### Files
 
 The input file for frequency analysis cannot contain the character for EOT \n
 since it's being used by the program as a stop point. \n
 The files can only be so large that it fits in memory. \n
 FILE0 and FILE1 can be the same while encoding.
 
 ### Compilation
 The program can be compiled with the the line: \n
 gcc  -g huffman.c trie.c list.c pqueue.c htable.c freq_table.c bit_buffer.c encode_decode.c 
 
 
 ## Dependecies
 The program expects these to be installed:
 
 #### For compiling
 - GCC 
 - Make
 
 
 ### Encode
 The -encode flag encodes FILE1 according to frequence analysis done on FILE0 and stores the result in FILE2 \n
 Example of this can be shown in Figure 1.

 In this example we run the program using the -encode flag. \n
 We use l√∂remipsum.txt for frequency analysis and then we encode \n
 the file liten.txt. The result is then stored in out.txt.
 
 ### Decode
 The -decode flag decodes FILE1 according to frequence analysis done on FILE0 and stores the result in FILE2
 
 Example of this can be shown in figure 2.

 Here we use the same frequency files as in Figure 1 to decode the file out.txt. \n
 We then store the resulting file in decoded.txt \n
